    <!-- Biography -->
    <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
    <p>
      <strong> Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, </strong>
      DBE (n√©e Miller; 15 September 1890 - 12 January 1976) was an English
      writer known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections,
      particularly those revolving around fictional detectives Hercule Poirot
      and Miss Marple. She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the
      murder mystery The Mousetrap, which has been performed in the West End of
      London since 1952. A writer during the "Golden Age of Detective Fiction",
      Christie has been called the "Queen of Crime". She also wrote six novels
      under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by
      Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. Guinness World
      Records lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her
      novels having sold more than two billion copies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay,
      Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful
      writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when The
      Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was
      published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914
      and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her
      marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international
      headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she
      served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the
      poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays.
      Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent
      several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her
      first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to UNESCO's Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated
      individual author.[1] Her novel And Then There Were None is one of the
      top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold.
      Christie's stage play The Mousetrap holds the world record for the longest
      initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25
      November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances.
      The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in
      London before it reopened in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of
      America's Grand Master Award. Later that year, Witness for the Prosecution
      received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best
      crime writer and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd the best crime novel ever by
      600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers' Association. In 2015, And
      Then There Were None was named the "World's Favourite Christie" in a vote
      sponsored by the author's estate.[2] Many of Christie's books and short
      stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic
      novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work

    <h3>Pharmacology</h3>
    <p>
      During the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train
      for the Apothecaries Hall Examination:XI While she subsequently found
      dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable
      than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in
      potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her
      skills up to date at Torquay Hospital
    </p>
    <h3>Archaeology</h3>
    <p>
      In her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities After her
      marriage to Mallowan in 1930, she accompanied him on annual expeditions,
      spending three to four months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation
      sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and
      Nimrud.The Mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from
      expedition sites, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt, Iran, and the Soviet
      Union, among other places. Their experiences travelling and living abroad
      are reflected in novels such as Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the
      Nile, and Appointment with Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to
      continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing
      room to the team's house at Nimrud. She also devoted time and effort each
      season in "making herself useful by photographing, cleaning, and recording
      finds; and restoring ceramics, which she especially enjoyed". She also
      provided funds for the expeditions
