          This homemade pizza margherita, named for Queen Margherita of Italy,
          shows off the colors of the Italian flag with red tomatoes, white
          mozzarella and fresh green basil. You'll be glad the recipe makes not
          one but two 13-inch pizzas! —Loretta Lawrence, Myrtle Beach, South

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><u>3 teaspoons active dry yeast</u></li>
      <li><u>2 tablespoons olive oil</u></li>
      <li><u>1 teaspoon sugar</u></li>
      <li><u>1 teaspoon salt</u></li>
      <li><u>3 cups bread flour</u></li>
      <li><u>1 cup warm water (110° to 115°)</u></li>
    </ul>
    <h5>toppings:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>8 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>20 fresh basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cans (14-1/2 ounces each) diced tomatoes, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine
        the oil, sugar, salt and 1 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough
        remaining flour to form a soft dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn onto a floured surface; knead for 6-8 minutes or until smooth and
        elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover
        and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch dough down; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 13-in.
        circle. Transfer to 2 greased 14-in. pizza pans; build up edges
        slightly. Cover with a clean kitchen towel; let rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon tomatoes over dough. Top with cheese, oregano, basil, pepper
        flakes, salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil. Bake at 450° for 15-20
        minutes or until crust is golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>What can you do if the dough springs back when you roll it out?</h4>
    <p>
      Sometimes your dough will spring back, but that’s OK. Let it rest on the
      counter for a few minutes, then use a rolling pin or your fingers to
      stretch the dough to your desired size. If you’ve refrigerated your dough,
      make sure it's at room temperature or it will continue to spring back.
      Read these tips from a pizza chef to make your best pie at home.

    <h4>Can you make margherita pizza ahead of time?</h4>
    <p>
      This whole pizza can be made ahead of time, or you can just make the dough
      ahead. Once your dough is kneaded, place it into an oiled bowl, seal with
      plastic, and let it hang out in the fridge overnight. To use, let it come
      to room temperature. You can also use this dough to make other great
      recipes like stromboli or calzones.
    </p>
    <h4>Can you use fresh mozzarella instead of shredded?</h4>
    <p>
      Fresh mozzarella is a great way to level up this pizza. It won`t be a true
      margherita pizza if you add more toppings—but feel free to throw
      pepperoni, sausage or your favorite toppings on as well. Here's the best
      way to reheat pizza (if you have leftovers).
